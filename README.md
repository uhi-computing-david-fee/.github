# Organisation README Repository

This repository exists solely to provide the profile README for the organisation.

It is **not a teaching resource** and contains **no course content**.

## Purpose
- Stores the organisation profile README displayed at:  [UHI Computing (David Fee)](https://github.com/uhi-computing-david-fee)
- Acts as the single source of truth for the repo index shown to students
- Updated when new teaching repositories are added or restructured

## Notes
- This README does **not** need branches
- This README does **not** need issues enabled
- This README should stay minimal and functional
- Changes should prioritise clarity over detail

---

_Last updated manually when the organisation structure changes._
